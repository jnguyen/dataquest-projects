# Dataquest Projects

This is a repository of my solutions to the guided projects from the Data Scientist Python track at [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io). 

## Machine Learning

These projects focus on developing machine learning models using the excellent `sklearn` package. Data cleaning and visualization are handled using `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

### [Project: Predicting Car Prices (KNN)](Predicting_Car_Prices/knn_car_prices.ipynb)

## SQL and Python

These projects focus on answering business questions and designing databases using SQLite3 and Python. Data is pulled by writing SQLite3 queries which are then executed using the`sqlite3` package in Python. The data is then analyzed using `pandas` and visualized using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`, with a focus on business growth metrics.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

These projects focus on exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and data visualization on Python using the `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` packages.
